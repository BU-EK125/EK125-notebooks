EK125 — Class 14: Scripts, Comments, and Documentation
Group Practice Problems (Teams of 3)
Spring 2026

Team Members:
- Your Name
- Partner 1 Name  
- Partner 2 Name

Instructions:
- Work in groups of THREE
- You MAY use references (readings, slides, internet)
- Do NOT use AI to write code - you need to learn yourself!
- Focus on PROFESSIONAL CODE today - documentation matters!
- Save frequently (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)

# PROBLEM 1: Good Comments vs. Bad Comments
# ==============================================================================
"""
Below are examples of comments. Identify which are GOOD and which are BAD.
Then rewrite the bad ones to be better.

Remember: Good comments explain WHY, not WHAT. They clarify non-obvious logic.
"""

# Example 1:
x = x + 1  # Add 1 to x
# Is this a good or bad comment?
# 


# Example 2:
# Apply 20% curve because this exam was particularly challenging
final_grade = raw_score * 1.20
# Is this a good or bad comment?
# 


# Example 3:
total = sum(numbers)  # Calculate the total of all numbers
# Is this a good or bad comment?
# 


# Example 4:
# Convert temperature to Celsius for consistency with weather API
temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5/9
# Is this a good or bad comment?
# 


# TODO: Find one line of code in your previous homework and write
# a GOOD comment for it (explain WHY, not WHAT)

# PROBLEM 2: Adding Docstrings to Functions
# ==============================================================================
"""
Below is a function with NO documentation. Add a proper docstring that includes:
- Brief description of what the function does
- Parameters (with types and descriptions)
- Return value (with type and description)
- An example of usage

# PROBLEM 3: Script Organization
# ==============================================================================
"""
Below is messy code. Reorganize it properly using these principles:

1. Module docstring at the top
2. Imports next
3. Constants (if any)
4. Function definitions (with docstrings!)
5. Main program code
6. Use if __name__ == "__main__": pattern

Messy code to fix:

    return weight / (height ** 2)

import math

result = calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)
print(f"BMI: {result:.1f}")

# PROBLEM 4: Professional Temperature Converter
# ==============================================================================
"""
Create a COMPLETE, professionally documented temperature conversion script.

Requirements:
1. Module docstring at top explaining what the script does
2. Three functions (each with proper docstrings):
   - celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)
   - fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit)
   - kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin)
3. Each function should:
   - Have a clear, descriptive docstring
   - Include parameter and return descriptions
   - Have an example in the docstring
4. Use the if __name__ == "__main__": pattern
5. Include helpful (not obvious) comments where needed

Create your complete solution below:

1. Add a proper docstring

# ==============================================================================
"""
Create a GPA calculator module that can be both:
1. Imported and used by other programs
2. Run directly as a script

Your module should include:
- Module docstring
- calculate_gpa(grades, credits) function with proper docstring
- letter_grade(gpa) function with proper docstring
- main() function that demonstrates usage
- if __name__ == "__main__": pattern

GPA Calculation: sum(grade * credit) / sum(credits)

# ==============================================================================
"""
Write a function called analyze_sensor_data that:
- Takes a list of temperature readings (floats)
- Returns: count, average, min, max, and readings above 75°F

This function must demonstrate ALL of these documentation best practices:
1. Module-level docstring (at the very top of this section)
2. Function docstring with Parameters and Returns sections
3. Example usage in the docstring
4. Helpful comments explaining WHY, not WHAT
5. Clear variable names
6. Proper formatting and structure

Explain in your own words:

1. What does if __name__ == "__main__": mean?



2. When does Python set __name__ to "__main__"?



3. Why is this pattern useful?



4. What happens if you DON'T use this pattern?



Now write a simple example that demonstrates this pattern:

If you finish early, create a complete statistics module!

Requirements:
- Module docstring explaining the purpose
- At least 4 functions: mean, median, mode, standard_deviation
- Each function with complete docstrings

- Helper functions if useful
- main() function showing examples
