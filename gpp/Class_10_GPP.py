Complete these quick exercises to practice basic slicing.
Each answer should be a single slice expression on one line.

    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

Write slices to extract:
  1.  "Pyt" from word
  2.  "hon" from word
  3.  "th"  from word
  4.  [10, 20, 30] from numbers
  5.  [40, 50, 60] from numbers
  6.  [70, 80, 90] from numbers
  7.  [10, 30, 50, 70, 90] from numbers  (every other, starting at index 0)
  8.  [20, 40, 60, 80] from numbers      (every other, starting at index 1)
  9.  90 as a single value               (using a negative index)

Ask the user for a word and check if it is a palindrome - a word that reads
the same forwards and backwards.

Use slicing to reverse the word, then compare it to the original.

  Enter a word: python
  "python" is not a palindrome.

  Enter a word: racecar

.index() / .rfind() to extract:
  1. The first word (everything before the first space)
  2. The last word (everything after the last space)
  3. The middle portion (everything between the first and last space)

Hint: str.index(' ') finds the first space. str.rfind(' ') finds the last.

# PROBLEM 8: Slice Assignment
# ==============================================================================
"""
Use SLICE ASSIGNMENT to modify three different lists in place.

Task 1: On list1, replace indices 2, 3, 4 with the single value 99.
  Original: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
  After:    [10, 20, 99, 60]

Task 2: On list2, replace every third element (indices 0, 3, 6) with "SKIP".
  Original: ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i"]
  After:    ["SKIP", "b", "c", "SKIP", "e", "f", "SKIP", "h", "i"]

Task 3: On list3, insert [100, 200, 300] between indices 3 and 4.
  Original: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  After:    [1, 2, 3, 100, 200, 300, 4, 5]

After each modification, print the before and after. Use the labels shown
in the expected output below.

Hint for Task 2: slice assignment with a step requires the replacement list
to be the SAME LENGTH as the slice.
Hint for Task 3: assigning to an empty slice (list3[3:3]) inserts without
removing anything.
